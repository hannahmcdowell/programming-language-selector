# Programming Language Selector Quiz

by Hannah McDowell

*A short quiz to help you decide which programming language to learn first!*

## Description
This webpage provides users with a five question quiz that determines which programming language they should learn first, based on their programming goals.

## Technologies/Frameworks Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* JavaScript

## Setup Instructions
1. Make sure [git is installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local device
2. Clone this repository onto your local device: `git clone [repo link]`
3. Open the cloned repository
4. Navigate to the top level of the directory
5. Open the `index.html` file using any internet browser to see the webpage

## Known Bugs
* When the user leaves fields blank, the website does not highlight the specific fields that they need to complete.
* When the user presses the submit button, I would like the screen to automatically scroll to the bottom of the page where the results appear. The current link does not work as intended.

## Future Features
I hope to add:
* [Form validation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/forms/#validation) using Bootstrap styling
* Images for each programming language
* Colorful styling using custom CSS and Bootstrap
